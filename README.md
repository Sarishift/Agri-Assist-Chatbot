Agri-Assist: Your Friendly Farming Companion
This is an AI chatbot project called Agri-Assist, developed to assist Indian farmers with their everyday requirements. We made this bot to address a simple yet large issue: farmers seldom have handy information about their crops, insects, and planting schedules.

The Problem ðŸ˜•
Most farmers, particularly in the countryside, receive information from sources that are not always timely or accurate. They can also struggle to read and decipher complicated guides. This poor-quality information can result in decreased crop harvests and financial losses.

Our Solution  ðŸ¤–
Agri-Assist is a straightforward, voice-activated chatbot that behaves like a personal agricultural specialist. It provides farmers with instant guidance via a basic chat interface they can access on any smartphone. The bot is also programmed to comprehend and respond to local languages such as Marathi, making it an incredibly accessible system.

Key Features  ðŸŽ¯
Pesticide and Crop Advice: Farmers can query on pests, diseases, and appropriate pesticides to apply.

Seasonal Updates: It gives details on the ideal planting and harvesting times for various crops.

Multilingual Support: It supports both English and Marathi, overcoming the language barrier.

Simple Interface: It is an extremely simple interface to use, even for individuals who are low in digital literacy.

What's Next?  ðŸš€
We intend to implement more features such as real-time market prices and a reminder system in the future to assist farmers with their daily activities. Our vision is to provide Agri-Assist as a complete companion to all farmers.

The Project shows how the technology can help to solve the real ground level problem which are often ignored.
